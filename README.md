# PYTHON SETUP

## 1. Overview

This repository contains tutorials to walk you through installing Python and getting started with your first Python project on your own computer.

There are many ways to install and run Python. Here, we provide instructions for our recommended set up for new Python users that involves:

1. installing and using the coding editor and IDE (Integrated Development Environment) software **Visual Studio Code**

2. installing and using `uv` to assist in the installation of Python and the creation of reproducible and transportable coding projects (using something called "virtual environments").

3. following computational and coding best practices to set up a Python project.

## 2. Creator(s) / Author(s)

## 3. Designed for:

+ in-person / virtual instruction
+ *or* asynchronous, self-paced learning
  
## 4. Learning Objectives

Upon completing the lessons offered here, the student will be able to:

+ install and run Python on their local computer, whether it be a Mac, PC, or Linux
+ set up a new Python project in Visual Studio Code from scratch following programming and computational best practices.
+ import an existing Python project and modify it within VSC.
+ write their first markdown file (`README.md`)
+ write and run their first Python script and Python Jupyter notebook.
