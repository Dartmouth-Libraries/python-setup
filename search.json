In this tutorial, we will import the repository for Dartmouth Libraries’ Python Essential Workshop Series.\nClick the green “Code” button on the repository page\nSelect “Download ZIP”\nExtract the ZIP file to a memorable location (e.g., ~/Documents/Python-Courses/)\nImportant: To get updates, you’ll need to re-download\n\n\n\n\nThis method is recommended for users familiar with git and Github, have git installed, have a Github account, and who wish to create a dynamic copy (“clone”) of the repository. A clone allows you to update your local repo when its online counterpart as been updated (using the pull command in git). It also allows you to push any changes you made locally back up to the remote repository, but only if the repository administrator has given you these privileges.\nIf you have Git installed:\n# before cloning, move the current working directory to the folder where you want to clone this project\ngit clone [REPOSITORY-URL]\n# for example:\n# git clone git@github.com:Dartmouth-Libraries/py-essentials_ws.git\nTo update the local version of the repository after the online version has been updated:\ngit pull origin main\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncd path/to/[repository-name]\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can tell if a repository is set up for uv if it has a uv.lock file in its root folder.\nRun the following in the terminal:\n# This creates a .venv directory and installs all packages\nuv sync\nThis command:\n\nCreates a virtual environment in .venv/\nInstalls Python if the correct version isn’t available\nInstalls all packages specified in pyproject.toml\nCreates/updates uv.lock for reproducibility\n\n\n\n\nPrior to uv, Python project dependencies were usually stored in a requirements.txt file.

Spaces cause issues in terminals. For Python code and folders containing Python code, it is recommended to avoid hyphens too as Python has difficulty importing code from folders or files with hyphens or any special characters besides underscores. Using hyphens for data files is perfectly fine.\nAvoid special characters with exception of underscore _ whenever possible.\nUse number prefixes for sequences: 01_, 02_, 03_ keeps scripts in order\nInclude dates if relevant: YYYY_MM_DD or YYYYMMDD to format sorts chronologically (you may also use hyphens, i.e. YYYY-MM-DD for data files and other files or folders that DO NOT contain Python code).\nConsistent within a project: Pick a style and stick with it\n\nFor general file management naming conventions see Harvard’s guide to file naming.\nFor Python specific naming conventions (for files and folders, but also for the names of variables, functions, classes, etc. see The Pep 8 Style Guide."

    "text": "This document provides detailed instructions for setting up your Python environment for this course/workshop. You should have already read the information in the 00_setup_slides and completed the installation of Visual Studio Code and Python using uv by following Setup Notebook 01.\n\n\n\nsetup project in Visual Studio Code (10 mins.)\nwrite your first markdown document (10)\nset up virtual environment\nwrite your first script\nwrite your first notebook\nimport external data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new folder for your sample project in a place which you can easily find again. Follow recommended file naming projects (outlined in 00_setup_slides) such as using underscores _ in place of whitespace, avoiding special characters, etc. i.e.:\n~/Users/your-user-name/Documents/python_code/sample_project\n\n\n\n\nVisual Studio Code and other IDEs allow you to load an entire project at once. Thus, you can easily switch between projects and when you return to a given project all the same files that were open before are opened once again. Below, we will open our sample project folder and modify it.\n\nOpen Visual Studio Code, which you installed with notebook 01.\nClick on File –&gt; Open Folder. Navigate to your new project folder and open it.\nIn the left pane of VSC, click on the Explorer icon (looks like pages or files) and you will see your empty folder there.\n\nAdd the following folders using the **+ Folder icon **:\n\n|--code\n|--data\n|--docs\n|--results\n\n\n\n\n\nAs noted in the opening slides presentation (html or pdf) “A virtual environment keeps each project’s packages separate and organized, preventing conflicts and making your code easy to share.”\nWe will now use uv to create a virtual environment for our sample project.\n\n\n\nSelect the Terminal tab at the top of VSC –&gt; New Terminal\nA new terminal should appear at the bottom.\nIf you are using a PC, it is recommended you use a Command Prompt terminal instead of Powershell. To open Command, select the + symbol at the far right side of the terminal pane, and select Command Prompt.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the terminal, you can test to see if VSC can find your Python and uv installations (just as we did in notebook 01) by running the following code:\n\nuv --version\nuv python list\n\n\n\nMake sure you are in the project root folder, i.e. your terminal should look like something like this (with a path to your project directory shown):\n\nIf you are not in the project root directory you can navigate to it by using the cd (change directory) command. Some tips:\n\nto navigate up one directory type cd ..\nto navigate up 3 directories type cd ../../..\nto navigate from the current working directory into your code folder type cd code.\nto navigate down two directories, type something like this: cd code/scripts (assuming the code folder is in your current working directory and a scripts folder is inside of that.\n\nNow, run the following in your project’s root directory from the terminal:\n# This initiaties a new uv environment for your project\nuv init\nYou will see in the Explorer pane on the left side of VSC several new files and folders were created in your project’s working directory. The above command:\n\nInstalled Python if the correct version isn’t available\nCreated a pyproject.toml file, where uv will store information about the packages / dependencies used in this project.\nCreated a .python-version file to store the version of Python used for this project.\n\n\n\n\nInitiating uv may also create a uv.lock file and a '.venv folder if you have already installed some packages. Let’s test this out by installing a package to our local environment at which point this file and folder will be created:\nRun in the terminal:\nuv add requests\nCertainly, now you should see the following in your project’s root directory:\n-   a `uv.lock` file which may be used by others (or by yourself in a different environment) to reproduce the exact same computing environment for your project.\n\n-   a `.venv` folder where the code for all projects added to the local environment are stored\nYou can also install / add multiple packages at once:\nuv add numpy pandas rich\nYou can use uv remove to uninstall packages. We really didn’t need requests. Let’s uninstall it:\nuv remove requests\nYou can review what packages have been installed in multiple ways. You can open either the pyproject.toml or the uv.lock file. Or you can run the following in the terminal:\nuv pip list\nYou should see something like this:\nPackage         Version\n--------------- -----------\nmarkdown-it-py  4.0.0\nmdurl           0.1.2\nnumpy           2.4.1\npandas          2.3.3\npygments        2.19.2\npython-dateutil 2.9.0.post0\npytz            2025.2\nrich            14.2.0\nsix             1.17.0\ntzdata          2025.3\n*Note: the .toml file and uv pip list return all packages installed including dependencies. For example, when we installed rich, UV also installed the packages rich depends on: markdown-it-py, mdurl, and pygments. In contrast, the uv.lock just lists the actual packages that you, the user, installed:\ndependencies = [\n    \"numpy&gt;=2.4.1\",\n    \"pandas&gt;=2.3.3\",\n    \"rich&gt;=14.2.0\",\n]\nThis is because uv.lock serves as instructions for the re-creation of this environment on another computer. If you were to open this project on a different computer, you would run the command uv sync, which would recreate your environment by installing the specific versions of numpy, pandas, and rich you have installed on your machine. When those are installed, their dependencies will be automatically installed as well.\nNow, try running this:\npip list\nNotice any difference from the results returned by uv pip list? In my case this second command returned many, many more packages? Why? It’s because the uv command automatically just retrieves the names of packages installed to the local virtual environment, whereas pip is retrieving all packages installed. That is why, under the pip system, you need to activate your virtual environment with .venv/Scripts/activate (Windows) or .venv/bin/activate (Macs) every time you open a project. Fortunately, with uv, we are automatically using the virtual environment whenever we call uv within a project that has one.\n\n\n\nOne final step: every time we start a new project in VSC we need to configure VSC to use the correct version of Python. We can do this by selecting our Python interpreter:\n\nOpen the “Show and Run Command Bars” (either select from central dropdown project menu at top of screen or by clicking CTRL + SHIFT + P on Windows or CMD + CTRL + SPACE on a Mac)\nSearch for and select Python: Select Interpreter\n\n\n\nSelect “Python: Select Interpreter” from Show and Run Command Bars\n\n\nChoose the version of Python installed to your local environment. It should look something like this: `Python 3.14.2 (name-of-project) .venv/Scripts/python.exe Recommended”\n\n\n\nSelect the version of Python found within your local project environment\n\n\n\nLet’s view which version of Python is being used by this project. Run the following in the terminal:\nuv run python --version\n\n\n\n\n ✅ Install VS Code\n ✅ Install Python extension (ms-python.python)\n ✅ Install Jupyter extension\n ✅ Open project folder\n ✅ Select interpreter: Ctrl+Shift+P → \"Python: Select Interpreter\" → .venv\n ✅ Configure terminal to use uv\n\n\n\nA markdown file is a text file that allows you to use simple symbols to specify its formatting. This notebook and the 00_setup_slides presentation were both created using markdown.\nSome commonly used symbols:\n# Header level 1 (note '#' should be the first symbol on the line and followed by a single whitespace)\n## Header level 2\n### Header level 3\n**bold**\n*italics*\n[filename](link/to/file)   # to create hyperlinks\n```\nplace code blocks between sets of 3 back ticks\n```\nIn the Explorer pane on the left, create a new file using the + File icon and name it README.md (.md is the extension for a markdown file).\nCreate a skeletal outline of a README file using headers of different levels, bold, italics, links, and code blocks (see the symbol directory above or the Markdown Guide’s Cheat Sheet for more examples of Markdown syntax). Include the following information:\n\ntentative name of your project\nname(s) of author(s) (you!)\nOverview section\nData section\nMethods section\n\nSave the file.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a Python script in your code/ folder and name it something like this: greeting.py.\n\nCreate a new script either by navigating to the code/ folder, right-clicking it, and selecting New File. Be sure to give the file the .py extension.\nOR File –&gt; New File and then give your file a name and place it in the code folder.\n*Note: using the correct extension is essential so the computer knows how to read it. A .py file is a plain text file containing Python code that can be run with software like VSC or from the command line.*\n\nType / paste in the following code (modifying it to make it your own) in the Python script:\n\n# Get the user's name\nname = input(\"What's your name? \")\n\n# print(name, \"is a beautiful name.\")\n\nSave the script (important: when you run a script it will only run the most recently saved version).\nRun your script in the terminal using uv:\n\nuv run code/greeting.py\n\nOther options to run this file:\n\nRight-click anywhere within greeting.py (in VSC) and select Run Python –&gt; Run Python File in Terminal\nYou can also run the script by selecting the Play icon button at the top of the editor window where you have greeting.py. Note: with this method, you are NOT using uv to run the script. Therefore, VSC may not know which Python version on your computer to run or it may choose a version that doesn’t work. If you get an error: choose the version that looks something like this: Python 3.XX.X (sample-project) .\\.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe              Workspace.\n\n\n\n\nadd to your Python script:\n# Get their favorite color\ncolor = input(\"What's your favorite color? \")\n\n# Respond based on their color choice\nif color.lower() == \"blue\":\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}! Blue is a calm and peaceful color. Great choice!\")\nelif color.lower() == \"red\":\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}! Red is bold and energetic.

Write code\n2. See the results immediately\n3. Add notes about what I learned\n\n&gt; **Tip:** Press `Shift + Enter` to run a cell!\n\n\n\n\nLet’s experiment by creating a data visualization using some popular Python packages.\n\nCreate a new notebook and name it plotting_penguins.ipynb or something like that.\nNext, we need to install the following Python libraries / packages:\n\npandas - for working with data tables\nmatplotlib - for creating data visualizations\nseaborn - some additional functionality and assistance working with matplotlib\n\n\nTo install these, we will use uv in the terminal:\nuv add pandas matplotlib seaborn\nNote: we can install multiple packages at once using this syntax.\n\nIn the first code cell in the new notebook, let’s install the necessary packages:\n\n\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n\nNext, we can import a preloaded dataset from seaborn and preview its data:\n\n\n# Load a built-in dataset (no files needed!)\npenguins = sns.load_dataset('penguins')\n\n# Take a quick look at the data\nprint(\"🐧 Palmer Penguins Dataset\")\nprint(\"=\" * 50)\nprint(penguins.head())\nprint(f\"\\nTotal penguins: {len(penguins)}\")\nprint(f\"Species: {penguins['species'].unique()}\")\n\n🐧 Palmer Penguins Dataset\n==================================================\n  species     island  bill_length_mm  bill_depth_mm  flipper_length_mm  \\\n0  Adelie  Torgersen            39.1           18.7              181.0   \n1  Adelie  Torgersen            39.5           17.4              186.0   \n2  Adelie  Torgersen            40.3           18.0              195.0   \n3  Adelie  Torgersen             NaN            NaN                NaN   \n4  Adelie  Torgersen            36.7           19.3              193.0   \n\n   body_mass_g     sex  \n0       3750.0    Male  \n1       3800.0  Female  \n2       3250.0  Female  \n3          NaN     NaN  \n4       3450.0  Female  \n\nTotal penguins: 344\nSpecies: ['Adelie' 'Chinstrap' 'Gentoo']\n\n\n\nNow, let’s create a pair plot of this data:\n\n\n# Create visualization in ONE line!\nsns.pairplot(penguins, hue='species', palette='husl')\n\nplt.suptitle('🐧 Penguin Data Overview', y=1.01, fontsize=16, fontweight='bold')\nplt.show()\n\nC:\\Users\\F0040RP\\Documents\\DartLib_RDS\\projects\\python-setup\\.venv\\Lib\\site-packages\\IPython\\core\\pylabtools.py:170: UserWarning: Glyph 128039 (\\N{PENGUIN}) missing from font(s) DejaVu Sans.\n  fig.canvas.print_figure(bytes_io, **kw)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr, we can create a scatterplot with additional customization:\n\n# Create a colorful visualization\nsns.set_style(\"whitegrid\")\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\n\n# Scatter plot: flipper length vs body mass, colored by species\nsns.scatterplot(\n    data=penguins,\n    x='flipper_length_mm',\n    y='body_mass_g',\n    hue='species',\n    size='body_mass_g',\n    sizes=(50, 400),\n    alpha=0.7,\n    palette='Set2'\n)"

    "text": "As noted in the opening slides presentation (html or pdf) “A virtual environment keeps each project’s packages separate and organized, preventing conflicts and making your code easy to share.”\nWe will now use uv to create a virtual environment for our sample project.\n\n\n\nSelect the Terminal tab at the top of VSC –&gt; New Terminal\nA new terminal should appear at the bottom.\nIf you are using a PC, it is recommended you use a Command Prompt terminal instead of Powershell. To open Command, select the + symbol at the far right side of the terminal pane, and select Command Prompt.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the terminal, you can test to see if VSC can find your Python and uv installations (just as we did in notebook 01) by running the following code:\n\nuv --version\nuv python list\n\n\n\nMake sure you are in the project root folder, i.e. your terminal should look like something like this (with a path to your project directory shown):\n\nIf you are not in the project root directory you can navigate to it by using the cd (change directory) command. Some tips:\n\nto navigate up one directory type cd ..\nto navigate up 3 directories type cd ../../..\nto navigate from the current working directory into your code folder type cd code.\nto navigate down two directories, type something like this: cd code/scripts (assuming the code folder is in your current working directory and a scripts folder is inside of that.\n\nNow, run the following in your project’s root directory from the terminal:\n# This initiaties a new uv environment for your project\nuv init\nYou will see in the Explorer pane on the left side of VSC several new files and folders were created in your project’s working directory. The above command:\n\nInstalled Python if the correct version isn’t available\nCreated a pyproject.toml file, where uv will store information about the packages / dependencies used in this project.\nCreated a .python-version file to store the version of Python used for this project.\n\n\n\n\nInitiating uv may also create a uv.lock file and a '.venv folder if you have already installed some packages. Let’s test this out by installing a package to our local environment at which point this file and folder will be created:\nRun in the terminal:\nuv add requests\nCertainly, now you should see the following in your project’s root directory:\n-   a `uv.lock` file which may be used by others (or by yourself in a different environment) to reproduce the exact same computing environment for your project.\n\n-   a `.venv` folder where the code for all projects added to the local environment are stored\nYou can also install / add multiple packages at once:\nuv add numpy pandas rich\nYou can use uv remove to uninstall packages. We really didn’t need requests. Let’s uninstall it:\nuv remove requests\nYou can review what packages have been installed in multiple ways. You can open either the pyproject.toml or the uv.lock file. Or you can run the following in the terminal:\nuv pip list\nYou should see something like this:\nPackage         Version\n--------------- -----------\nmarkdown-it-py  4.0.0\nmdurl           0.1.2\nnumpy           2.4.1\npandas          2.3.3\npygments        2.19.2\npython-dateutil 2.9.0.post0\npytz            2025.2\nrich            14.2.0\nsix             1.17.0\ntzdata          2025.3\n*Note: the .toml file and uv pip list return all packages installed including dependencies. For example, when we installed rich, UV also installed the packages rich depends on: markdown-it-py, mdurl, and pygments. In contrast, the uv.lock just lists the actual packages that you, the user, installed:\ndependencies = [\n    \"numpy&gt;=2.4.1\",\n    \"pandas&gt;=2.3.3\",\n    \"rich&gt;=14.2.0\",\n]\nThis is because uv.lock serves as instructions for the re-creation of this environment on another computer. If you were to open this project on a different computer, you would run the command uv sync, which would recreate your environment by installing the specific versions of numpy, pandas, and rich you have installed on your machine. When those are installed, their dependencies will be automatically installed as well.\nNow, try running this:\npip list\nNotice any difference from the results returned by uv pip list? In my case this second command returned many, many more packages? Why? It’s because the uv command automatically just retrieves the names of packages installed to the local virtual environment, whereas pip is retrieving all packages installed. That is why, under the pip system, you need to activate your virtual environment with .venv/Scripts/activate (Windows) or .venv/bin/activate (Macs) every time you open a project. Fortunately, with uv, we are automatically using the virtual environment whenever we call uv within a project that has one.\n\n\n\nOne final step: every time we start a new project in VSC we need to configure VSC to use the correct version of Python. We can do this by selecting our Python interpreter:\n\nOpen the “Show and Run Command Bars” (either select from central dropdown project menu at top of screen or by clicking CTRL + SHIFT + P on Windows or CMD + CTRL + SPACE on a Mac)\nSearch for and select Python: Select Interpreter\n\n\n\nSelect “Python: Select Interpreter” from Show and Run Command Bars\n\n\nChoose the version of Python installed to your local environment. It should look something like this: `Python 3.14.2 (name-of-project) .venv/Scripts/python.exe Recommended”\n\n\n\nSelect the version of Python found within your local project environment\n\n\n\nLet’s view which version of Python is being used by this project. Run the following in the terminal:\nuv run python --version"

Run the following in the terminal:\n\nuv add jupyter\n\n\n\n\nRight-click in the Explorer sidebar (where your files are)\nClick “New File”\nName it: my_first_notebook.ipynb\n\n-   The `.ipynb` extension is important!\n\nPress Enter\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the notebook opens, look at the top-right corner\nClick “Select Kernel”\nChoose “Python Environments…”\nSelect the one that says .venv or uv\n\n\n\n\n\nClick in the first cell\nType some Python code\nPress Shift + Enter to run the cell\nThat’s it! 🎉\n\n\n\n\nA short cheatsheet for working with Jupyter notebooks (or click here for a more extensive cheatsheet:\n╔══════════════════════════════════════════════╗\n║      JUPYTER NOTEBOOK SHORTCUTS              ║\n╠══════════════════════════════════════════════╣\n║                                              ║\n║  RUN CELL:                                   ║\n║  • Shift + Enter  (run and move to next)     ║\n║  • Ctrl + Enter   (run and stay)             ║\n║                                              ║\n║  ADD CELLS:                                  ║\n║  • Click \"+ Code\" or \"+ Markdown\" buttons    ║\n║  • Or use the + icon at top                  ║\n║                                              ║\n║  CHANGE CELL TYPE:                           ║\n║  • Use dropdown: \"Code\" or \"Markdown\"        ║\n║                                              ║\n║  DELETE CELL:                                ║\n║  • Click trash icon on left of cell          ║\n║                                              ║\n║  SAVE NOTEBOOK:                              ║\n║  • Ctrl + S (or Cmd + S on Mac)              ║\n║                                              ║\n║  RESTART KERNEL:                             ║\n║  • Click \"Restart\" icon at top               ║\n║  • Use when things get stuck                 ║\n║                                              ║\n╚══════════════════════════════════════════════╝\nCopy and paste these cells into your notebook to practice:\n\n\nClick the cell, then change it to “Markdown” using the dropdown at the top\n# 🎉 My First Jupyter Notebook\n\nWelcome to my coding adventure! Today I'm learning about Jupyter notebooks.\n\n## What I'll practice:\n- Running Python code in cells\n- Using **markdown** for notes\n- Making calculations\n- Creating simple visualizations\n---\n\n**Date:** January 2025  \n**Mood:** Excited! 🚀\n\n\n\n\n# Let's do some calculations!\nprint(\"🧮 Quick Math Practice\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\nmy_age = 25  # Change this to your age!\npython_age = 2025 - 1991  # Python was created in 1991\n\nprint(f\"I am {my_age} years old\")\nprint(f\"Python is {python_age} years old\")\nprint(f\"Python is {python_age - my_age} years older than me!\")\n\n🧮 Quick Math Practice\n------------------------------\nI am 25 years old\nPython is 34 years old\nPython is 9 years older than me!\n\n\n\n\n\n## 💭 My Observations\n\nThe cool thing about notebooks is that I can:\n1. Write code\n2. See the results immediately\n3. Add notes about what I learned\n\n&gt; **Tip:** Press `Shift + Enter` to run a cell!\n\n\n\n\nLet’s experiment by creating a data visualization using some popular Python packages.\n\nCreate a new notebook and name it plotting_penguins.ipynb or something like that.\nNext, we need to install the following Python libraries / packages:\n\npandas - for working with data tables\nmatplotlib - for creating data visualizations\nseaborn - some additional functionality and assistance working with matplotlib\n\n\nTo install these, we will use uv in the terminal:\nuv add pandas matplotlib seaborn\nNote: we can install multiple packages at once using this syntax.\n\nIn the first code cell in the new notebook, let’s install the necessary packages:\n\n\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n\nNext, we can import a preloaded dataset from seaborn and preview its data:\n\n\n# Load a built-in dataset (no files needed!)\npenguins = sns.load_dataset('penguins')\n\n# Take a quick look at the data\nprint(\"🐧 Palmer Penguins Dataset\")\nprint(\"=\" * 50)\nprint(penguins.head())\nprint(f\"\\nTotal penguins: {len(penguins)}\")\nprint(f\"Species: {penguins['species'].unique()}\")\n\n🐧 Palmer Penguins Dataset\n==================================================\n  species     island  bill_length_mm  bill_depth_mm  flipper_length_mm  \\\n0  Adelie  Torgersen            39.1           18.7              181.0   \n1  Adelie  Torgersen            39.5           17.4              186.0   \n2  Adelie  Torgersen            40.3           18.0              195.0   \n3  Adelie  Torgersen             NaN            NaN                NaN   \n4  Adelie  Torgersen            36.7           19.3              193.0   \n\n   body_mass_g     sex  \n0       3750.0    Male  \n1       3800.0  Female  \n2       3250.0  Female  \n3          NaN     NaN  \n4       3450.0  Female  \n\nTotal penguins: 344\nSpecies: ['Adelie' 'Chinstrap' 'Gentoo']\n\n\n\nNow, let’s create a pair plot of this data:\n\n\n# Create visualization in ONE line!\nsns.pairplot(penguins, hue='species', palette='husl')\n\nplt.suptitle('🐧 Penguin Data Overview', y=1.01, fontsize=16, fontweight='bold')\nplt.show()\n\nC:\\Users\\F0040RP\\Documents\\DartLib_RDS\\projects\\python-setup\\.venv\\Lib\\site-packages\\IPython\\core\\pylabtools.py:170: UserWarning: Glyph 128039 (\\N{PENGUIN}) missing from font(s) DejaVu Sans.\n  fig.canvas.print_figure(bytes_io, **kw)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr, we can create a scatterplot with additional customization:\n\n# Create a colorful visualization\nsns.set_style(\"whitegrid\")\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\n\n# Scatter plot: flipper length vs body mass, colored by species\nsns.scatterplot(\n    data=penguins,\n    x='flipper_length_mm',\n    y='body_mass_g',\n    hue='species',\n    size='body_mass_g',\n    sizes=(50, 400),\n    alpha=0.7,\n    palette='Set2'\n)"
