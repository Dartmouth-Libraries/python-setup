## 1. Overview

This repository contains tutorials to walk you through installing Python and getting started with your first Python project on your own computer.

There are many ways to install and run Python. Here, we provide instructions for **our recommended Python project set up** for new Python users that involves:

1.  installing and using the coding editor and IDE (Integrated Development Environment) software **Visual Studio Code** (VSC)

2.  installing and using **uv** to assist in the installation of Python and the creation of reproducible and transportable coding projects (using something called "virtual environments").

3.  following computational and coding best practices to set up a Python project.

Followers of our previously recommended approach using **pip** and **venv** within VSC may still find review those [instruction](setup/pip-venv_method.qmd).

These coding notebooks and other materials are stored in the [**python-setup**](https://github.com/Dartmouth-Libraries/python-setup) repository in Dartmouth Libraries Github.

## 2. Why UV?

1.  installs packages 10-100x faster than **pip**
2.  Single tool for everything (Python installation, resolving Python path conflicts, virtual enviroment set up, package installation and management)
3.  Automatic virtual environment management
4.  Cross-platform consistency
5.  Create stable and transportable package dependencies with lockfile

## 3. Designed for:

-   in-person / virtual instruction
-   *or* asynchronous, self-paced learning

...for Python beginners and those who have used Python before but want to learn how to better create, import, and manage projects on their own computer.

## 4. Learning Objectives

Upon completing the lessons offered here, the student will be able to:

-   install and run Python on their local computer, whether it be a Mac, PC, or Linux
-   set up a new Python project in Visual Studio Code from scratch following programming and computational best practices.
-   import an existing Python project and modify it within VSC.
-   write their first markdown file (`README.md`)
-   write and run their first Python script and Python Jupyter notebook.

## 6. Other Instructional Information

**Level:** Beginner (and Intermediate Users looking to establish better project practices)

**Duration:** Estimated time to complete: 2-3 hours (but could vary tremendously)

**Pre-requisites:**

```         
1.  User is comfortable navigating through files on their computer
```

## 7. Getting Started

To complete the set up tutorial, open the **setup/** folder and do the following in order:

1.  Review the [00_setup_slides](setup/00_setup_slides.html) presentation (*optional, but provides from useful background*)

2.  Complete the [Tutorial 1: Python Installation & Setup](setup/01_python_setup.qmd)

3.  Complete the [Tutorial 2: Create Python Project from Scratch](setup/02_create_project_from_scratch.qmd)

4.  Complete the [Tutorial 3: Import Existing Python Project](setup/03_import_project.qmd)

5.  Optional review: [UV Cheatsheet](setup/uv_cheatsheet.qmd)

6.  Further learning: Follow the lessons and activities in [Complete UV Tutorial: Python Development with UV and VS Code](setup/uv_detailed_instructions.qmd). *Note: this guide was mostly written by a non-human assistant, Claude Opus 4.5. It still needs human review and testing.*

## 8. Required Software

Instructions for installing the following are in the Set Up tutorials outlined in Step 6 above.

-   **Python** (version 3.12 or higher)
-   **Visual Studio Code**
-   **uv** (package manager)
