## Why Program? Why Program in a World of AI?

```{=html}
<!--Show of hands: How many of you have used ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot for coding?

Here's the reality: AI coding assistants are powerful, BUT:-->
```

-   understand code to verify AI outputs

-   debug when AI gives you broken code

-   need practice with computational thinking to break problems down

-   control your data and methods (unlike black-box AI tools)

-   preserve AGENCY over your research workflow

Think of AI as an assistant, but YOU are still the researcher who needs to understand and validate the work

# Why Python?

## Why Python?: It's popular

-   Most popular language in research <!--(show trend graph if available)-->

-   Massive ecosystem for research: pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, etc.

## Why Python? It's beginner-friendly

-   highly readable language (good for beginners)

## Python Example

```{python}
#| echo: true
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
average = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
print(f"Average: {average}")
```

## R

```         
numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
average <- mean(numbers)
print(paste("Average:", average))
```

## Java

```         
public class AverageCalculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        double sum = 0;
        
        for (int number : numbers) {
            sum += number;
        }
        
        double average = sum / numbers.length;
        System.out.println("Average: " + average);
    }
}
```

## C++

```         
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    double sum = std::accumulate(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(), 0);
    double average = sum / numbers.size();
    
    std::cout << "Average: " << average << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Javascript

```         
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const average = numbers.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0) / numbers.length;
console.log(`Average: ${average}`);
```

# Problem: Python setup is difficult

## Typical Python Setup

1.  Install Python
2.  install an IDE (Integrated Development Environment): software that combines tools for writing, editing, compiling, and debugging code.
3.  Install Python packages to "global" environment on your computer

## Resulting Problems

1.  IDE can't find Python ('Python is not recognized as a command' errors?)
2.  Code that worked on one computer but broke on another? (dependency conflicts)
3.  updating one project causes another not to work
4.  installing the wrong package causes your Python installation to break
5.  Multiple Python versions fighting each other?
6.  your project code works differently on different computers (making collaboration difficult)

## Common error messages:

::: incremental
-   `'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command`

-   `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pandas'`

-   `Python version mismatch`

-   `Permission denied`

# Python Setup

## Recommended Python Set Up Approach: UV + VSC

1.  **uv**: A new, fast tool that manages everything—Python versions,virtual environments, and packages—all in one place.
2.  **Visual Studio Code**: A modern editor that works seamlessly with uv and Python.
3.  Project best practices: folder/file organization; file-naming; virtual environment for each project; rigorous documentation
    1.  We're building good habits from day one, not adding them later.

# Hands-on Setup

Go to 01_setup-instructions (qmd, pdf, or html)

*Slides below offer "best practices" recommendations for setting up a Python project on your computer. For workshop participants, we will introduce these as we go. For asynchronous learners, you may want to review these on your own before continuing to notebook 01.*

# Python / Programming Best Practices

## Project Organization

One folder -- one project

<!-- "One project = one folder. Everything related to a study goes in one place."-->

## Project Organization

Folder Organization:

```         
my-research-project/
├── data/
│   ├── raw/              # Original, untouched data
│   └── processed/        # Cleaned, transformed data
├── code                  # this may include Python scripts (.py) and coding notebooks
├── results/
│   ├── figures/          # Plots and visualizations
│   └── tables/           # Output tables/statistics
├── docs/                 # Documentation, notes
├── .gitignore           # Tell git what NOT to track
├── README.md            # Project description and instructions
└── pyproject.toml       # Python dependencies (with uv)
```

## Project Organization

Why this structure?

```         
+ Separation of concerns: Raw data stays pristine, processed data is separate

+ Findability: Six months from now, you'll know where everything is
+ Collaboration: Others can navigate your project easily

+ Scalability: Works for small and large projects
```

Key principles:

```         
+ Keep raw data in data/raw/ and NEVER modify it directly
+ All data processing should be scripted and reproducible
+ Results should be generated by code, not manually created
+ One project = one self-contained folder"
```

## File Naming Conventions

Some common conventions:

1.  **Lowercase with underscores**: `my-script.py` or `my_script.py`

2.  **Be descriptive**: Names should tell you what the file contains or does

3.  **NO SPACES**: For file names, you should replace whitespace with hyphens or underscores instead. Spaces cause issues in terminals. **For Python code and folders containing Python code, it is recommended to avoid hyphens too as Python has difficulty importing code from folders or files with hyphens or any special characters besides underscores. Using hyphens for data files is perfectly fine.**

4.  **Avoid special characters** with exception of underscore `_` whenever possible.

5.  **Use number prefixes for sequences**: `01_`, `02_`, `03_` keeps scripts in order

6.  **Include dates if relevant**: `YYYY_MM_DD` or `YYYYMMDD` to format sorts chronologically (you may also use hyphens, i.e. `YYYY-MM-DD` for data files and other files or folders that DO NOT contain Python code).

7.  **Consistent within a project**: Pick a style and stick with it

For general file management naming conventions see [Harvard's guide to file naming](https://datamanagement.hms.harvard.edu/plan-design/file-naming-conventions).

For Python specific naming conventions (for files and folders, but also for the names of variables, functions, classes, etc. see [The Pep 8 Style Guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#naming-conventions).

## Documentation

Most important document: README.md file. This is where users go to first to learn more about a project.

What goes in a README:

1.  project title & overview
2.  how to set up / get started
3.  how to use
4.  data description
5.  description of other content
6.  how to cite
7.  license information

<!-- "Always include a README.md that explains:      What your project does     How to install dependencies     How to run your code     Future you (and other researchers) will thank present you!"  Quick interactive poll: "Who currently uses any of these practices? Don't worry if you don't—we're starting today!" -->

## Dependency Conflicts

**Problem**

-   Project A (from 2022) needs pandas version 1.3

-   Project B (new project) needs pandas version 2.0

If you just install your Python dependencies to a global environment (meaning they can be accessed anywhere on your personal computer) then your Python setup can only work for one of these packages. For example, if you try to run Project A, but you have pandas 2.0 installed on your computer, then you may receive a `dependency conflict` error.

## Solution: Virtual Environments

A **virtual environment** is like a **separate, isolated workspace** for each Python project on your computer.

A virtual environment keeps each project's packages separate and organized, preventing conflicts and making your code easy to share

Think of it as:

-   A **project-specific toolbox** that contains only the tools (packages) you need for that project

-   A **separate room** for each project, so things don't get mixed up

-   A **backpack** you pack differently for each trip/project

### Value of Virtual Environments

1.  avoid conflicts
2.  keep things clean
3.  easy sharing
4.  protect your system

WITHOUT Virtual Environments:
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│   YOUR COMPUTER             │
│                             │
│  All Projects → One Big     │
│  Messy Pile of Packages 😵  │
│                             │
│  (Conflicts! Confusion!)    │
└─────────────────────────────┘


WITH Virtual Environments:
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│   YOUR COMPUTER             │
│                             │
│  Project A → 📦 Its packages │
│  Project B → 📦 Its packages │
│  Project C → 📦 Its packages │
│                             │
│  (Clean! Organized! 😊)     │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

## Version Control (Git)

```{=html}
<!--
"Version control is like 'track changes' for code—on steroids.

    Tracks every change you make
    Lets you go back to previous versions
    Essential for collaboration
    GitHub/GitLab provide backups and sharing
    We'll initialize git for our projects today"
    -->
```

## IDEs (Integrated Development Environments)

An IDE is your coding workspace. Some examples (Visual Studio Code, Pycharm, Spyder, etc.). Today we are using Visual Studio Code (VSC) because":

-   Free and open source

-   Excellent Python support

-   Built-in git integration

-   Integrated terminal

-   IntelliSense (code completion)

-   Debugging tools

-   Works with both .py scripts and Jupyter notebooks

-   Huge extension ecosystem

-   Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux
