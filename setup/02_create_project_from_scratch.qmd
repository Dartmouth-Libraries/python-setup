# Create a Python Project from Scratch with Visual Studio Code & UV

This document provides detailed instructions for setting up your Python environment for this course/workshop. You should have already read the information in the [00_setup_slides](00_setup-slides.html) and completed the installation of Visual Studio Code and Python using uv by following [Setup Notebook 01](01_python-setup-instructions.qmd).

## Table of Contents

1.  setup project in Visual Studio Code
2.  set up virtual environment
3.  write your first markdown document
4.  write your first script
5.  write your first notebook
6.  import external data

## Set up sample project folder

1.  Create a new folder for your sample project in a place which you can easily find again. Follow recommended file naming projects (outlined in [00_setup_slides](00_setup_slides.html)) such as using underscores `_` in place of whitespace, avoiding special characters, etc. i.e.:

    ```         
    ~/Users/your-user-name/Documents/python_code/sample_project
    ```

## Open Project Folder in Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code and other IDEs allow you to load an entire project at once. Thus, you can easily switch between projects and when you return to a given project all the same files that were open before are opened once again. Below, we will open our sample project folder and modify it.

1.  Open Visual Studio Code, which you installed with [notebook 01](01_python_setup_instructions_uv.qmd).

2.  We are going to

3.  Click on **File** –\> **Open Folder**. Navigate to your new project folder and open it.

4.  In the left pane of VSC, click on the **Explorer** icon (looks like pages or files) and you will see your empty folder there.

5.  Add the following folders using the \*\*+ Folder icon \*\*:

```         
|--code
|--data
|--docs
|--results
```

![](images/screenshot_vsc-folder-setup.png){fig-alt="screenshot of sample folder as seen in VSC after setting up code, data, docs, and results folders."}

## Write your first markdown document

A **markdown** file is a text file that allows you to use simple symbols to specify its formatting. This notebook and the **00_setup_slides** presentation were both created using markdown.

Some commonly used symbols:

````         
# Header level 1 (note '#' should be the first symbol on the line and followed by a single whitespace)
## Header level 2
### Header level 3
**bold**
*italics*
[filename](link/to/file)   # to create hyperlinks
```
place code blocks between sets of 3 back ticks
```
````

In the Explorer pane on the left, create a new file using the **+ File icon** and name it `README.md` (**.md** is the extension for a markdown file).

Create a skeletal outline of a README file using headers of different levels, bold, italics, links, and code blocks (see the symbol directory above or the Markdown Guide's [Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for more examples of Markdown syntax). Include the following information:

1.  tentative name of your project
2.  name(s) of author(s) (you!)
3.  Overview section
4.  Data section
5.  Methods section

Save the file.

## Setting Up the Python Environment

\[explanation\]

### Open the command line in VSC

1.  Select the **Terminal** tab at the top of VSC –\> **New Terminal**
2.  A new terminal should appear at the bottom.
3.  If you are using a PC, it is recommended you use a **Bash** terminal instead of **Powershell**. To open Bash, select the `+` symbol at the far right side of the terminal pane, and select **Git Bash**.

# \[install Bash??\] \[Powershell UV code?\]

### Confirm VSC can find your Python and uv installations

1.  In the terminal, you can test to see if VSC can find your Python and uv installations (just as we did in notebook 01) by running the following code:

```         
uv --version
```

```         
uv python list
```

### Create Virtual Environment

Run the following in the terminal (make sure you are in the project root folder, i.e.:

![](images/screenshot_bash_rootdir.png)

```         
# This initiaties a new uv environment for your project
uv init
```

This command:

-   Creates the `.venv/` folder, where uv will store code for any packages / dependencies installed as part of this project.

-   Installs Python if the correct version isn't available

-   Creates a `pyproject.toml` file, where uv will store information about the packages / dependencies used in this project.

-   Creates a `.python-version` file to store the version of Python used for this project.

Let's view which version of Python is being used by this project:

```         
uv run python --version
```

-   Creates a `uv.lock` file which may be used by others (or by yourself in a different environment) to reproduce the exact same computing environment for your project.

## Write your first Python script

1.  Create a Python script in your **code/** folder and name it something like this: `greeting.py`. Note: using the correct extension is essential so the computer knows how to read it. A `.py` file is a plain text file containing Python code that can be run with software like VSC or from the command line.
2.  Type / paste in the following code (modifying it to make it your own):

```         
# Get the user's name
name = input("What's your name? ")

# print(name, "is a beautiful name.")
```

3.  Save the script (important: when you run a script it will only run the most recently saved version).
4.  Run your script in the terminal using uv:

```         
uv run code/greeting.py
```

5.  Other options to run this file:
    5.  **Right-click** anywhere within **greeting.py** (in VSC) and select **Run Python** –\> **Run Python File in Terminal**
    6.  You can also run the script by selecting the **Play icon button** at the top of the editor window where you have `greeting.py`. Note: since, with this method, you are NOT using uv to run the script, VSC may not know which Python version on your computer to run or it may choose a version that doesn't work. If you get an error, choose the version that looks something like this: `Python 3.XX.X (sample-project) .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe              Workspace`.

### Optional additions to script:

```         
# Get their favorite color
color = input("What's your favorite color? ")

# Respond based on their color choice
if color.lower() == "blue":
    print(f"Hello, {name}! Blue is a calm and peaceful color. Great choice!")
elif color.lower() == "red":
    print(f"Hello, {name}! Red is bold and energetic. I like it!")
elif color.lower() == "green":
    print(f"Hello, {name}! Green is the color of nature. Very refreshing!")
else:
    print(f"Hello, {name}! {color.title()} is a wonderful color!")
```

## Create a Script Requiring External Code from a Python Package

You can only do a few simple things with core Python code. Anything more complex - from data analysis to statistics, working with images and text, etc. - you will need to:

1.  install the package to your local environment using uv (do this once per project)
2.  import the package into any scripts or notebooks that use it (must include in each code script or notebook)

We will create a **random compliments generator** in a Python script, which requires the use of two packages:

-   **random** (which is part of the core Python installation and thus DOES NOT need to be installed, but DOES need to be imported) and

-   **rich** (which DOES NEED to be installed AND imported).

To install **rich** run the following in the terminal:

```         
uv add rich 
```

You can confirm the installation of this package to your local environment in multiple ways.

1.  Open the `pyproject.toml` file and you should see it listed among the dependencies.
2.  Open `uv.lock` and you can see information about the installed **rich** package.
3.  Reviewing code files for the rich package stored in `.venv/Lib/site-packages`.
4.  Typing `uv pip list` or `uv pip freeze` in the command line / terminal.

NOTE: Never manually modify any of the above unless you know what you are doing. These files and folders are manually updated by **uv** when you run uv commands.

Then paste / type the following into a new script called 'compliment_generator.py\`.

```         
import random
from rich import print

# List of compliments
compliments = [
    "You're doing an amazing job learning Python! 🎉",  # \U0001F389
    "Your curiosity is inspiring! 🌟",                  # \U00002B50
    "You have great potential as a programmer! 💻",
    "Keep up the excellent work! 🚀",                   # \U0001F680"
    "You're braver than you think for trying something new! 💪"
    "✨"
]

# Get user's name
name = input("What's your name? ")

# Pick a random compliment
chosen_compliment = random.choice(compliments)

# Print with color using rich
print(f"\n[bold cyan]Hey {name}![/bold cyan]")
print(f"[green]{chosen_compliment}[/green]\n")
```

Note: to acquire these and other emojis, you can acquire emojis:

1.  on a **PC** press `Windows + .` or `Windows + ;`
2.  On a Mac type `Command + Control + Space`.
3.  On a Linux type `Ctrl + .` or `Ctrl + ;`.

Try running this script from the command line using the same procedure introduced in the previous step.

## Write your first Jupyter Notebook

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: `uv: command not found`

**Solution:** The installation directory isn't in your PATH.

**Windows:**\
Add `%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin` to your PATH environment variable.

**macOS/Linux:**\
Add this to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or equivalent:

```{bash}
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
```

Then run: `source ~/.bashrc` (or `~/.zshrc`)

### Issue: "Python version X.Y required but X.Z found"

**Solution:** uv can install Python for you:

```{bash}
uv python install 3.11
uv sync
```

### Issue: Package installation fails with compilation errors

**Solution 1:** Ensure you have build tools installed

**Windows:**

-   Install [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022)

**macOS**:

```{bash}
xcode-select --install
```

Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):

```{bash}
sudo apt-get install build-essential python3-dev
```

**Solution 2:** Try installing pre-built wheels:

```{bash}
uv pip install --only-binary :all: [package-name]
```

### Issue: VS Code doesn't recognize the .venv interpreter

**Solution:**

1.  Make sure `.venv` folder exists in your project root

2.  Reload VS Code (Ctrl+Shift+P → "Developer: Reload Window")

3.  Manually browse to the interpreter:

```         
-   Windows: `.venv\Scripts\python.exe`

-   Mac/Linux: `.venv/bin/python`
```

### Issue: Jupyter notebooks won't run

**Solution:**

1.  Ensure Jupyter extension is installed

2.  Install ipykernel in your environment:

```{bash}
uv pip install ipykernel
```

1.  Select the `.venv` kernel when opening a notebook

2.  Restart VS Code if needed

### Issue: "Import could not be resolved" warnings in VS Code

**Solution:**

1.  Ensure you've selected the correct Python interpreter

2.  Check that `python.analysis.extraPaths` includes your project root

3.  Reload VS Code window

### Issue: Cannot write to `.venv` directory (permission errors)

**Solution:**

-   Don't use `sudo` with uv commands

-   Ensure you have write permissions to the project directory

-   On Windows, run terminal as regular user (not administrator)

### Issue: `uv sync` is very slow

**Possible causes:**

-   First run always takes longer

-   Slow internet connection

-   Antivirus scanning

**Solutions:**

-   Be patient on first run

-   Disable antivirus temporarily for `.venv` folder

-   Use `uv sync --offline` if you've run it before

## Best Practices for This Course

### File Organization

-   Keep all work within this project folder

-   Use relative paths (or `pathlib`)

-   Save scripts with descriptive names: `verb_noun.py` (e.g., `analyze_sales.py`)

### Naming Conventions

**Good:**

-   `clean_data.py`

-   `2024_01_15_sales_report.csv`

-   `figure_01_scatterplot.png`

**Bad:**

-   `script1.py`

-   `final FINAL (2) copy.py`

-   `sales data.csv` (spaces can be problematic)

### Running Python Code

**In Terminal:**

```{bash}
# Always use uv run to ensure correct environment
uv run python scripts
```
