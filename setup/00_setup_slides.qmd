# Why Program? Why Program in a World of AI?

```{=html}
<!--Show of hands: How many of you have used ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot for coding?

Here's the reality: AI coding assistants are powerful, BUT:-->
```

-   understand code to verify AI outputs

-   debug when AI gives you broken code

-   need practice with computational thinking to break problems down

-   control your data and methods (unlike black-box AI tools)

-   preserve AGENCY over your research workflow

Think of AI as an assistant, but YOU are still the researcher who needs to understand and validate the work

# Why Python?

-   Most popular language in research <!--(show trend graph if available)-->

-   Massive ecosystem for research: pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, etc.

## Why Python?

-   highly readable language (good for beginners)

```{python}
#| echo: true
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
average = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
print(f"Average: {average}")
```

```         
numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
average <- mean(numbers)
print(paste("Average:", average))
```

```         
public class AverageCalculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        double sum = 0;
        
        for (int number : numbers) {
            sum += number;
        }
        
        double average = sum / numbers.length;
        System.out.println("Average: " + average);
    }
}
```

```         
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    double sum = std::accumulate(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(), 0);
    double average = sum / numbers.size();
    
    std::cout << "Average: " << average << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

```         
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const average = numbers.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0) / numbers.length;
console.log(`Average: ${average}`);
```

## Why Python?

-   Strong community support

-   Free and open source

-   Cross-platform

-   Used across disciplines: from digital humanities to computational biology

# Problem: Python setup is difficult

Some common problems:

-   Code that worked on one computer but broke on another?

-   Confusion about pip vs conda vs virtualenv vs venv?

-   'Python is not recognized as a command' errors?

-   Breaking your Python installation by installing the wrong package?

-   Multiple Python versions fighting each other?

## Common error messages:

```         
'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pandas'
Python version mismatch
Permission denied
externally-managed-environment
```

## Python Set Up Approach

1.  uv: A new, fast tool that manages everything—Python versions,virtual environments, and packages—all in one place.
2.  VS Code: A modern editor that works seamlessly with uv and Python.
3.  Best practices: We're building good habits from day one, not adding them later.

# Python / Programming Best Practices

## Project Organization

One folder -- one project

<!-- "One project = one folder. Everything related to a study goes in one place."-->

## Project Organization

Folder Organization:

```         
my-research-project/
├── data/
│   ├── raw/              # Original, untouched data
│   └── processed/        # Cleaned, transformed data
├── scripts/              # Python scripts (.py files)
├── notebooks/            # Jupyter notebooks for exploration
├── results/
│   ├── figures/          # Plots and visualizations
│   └── tables/           # Output tables/statistics
├── docs/                 # Documentation, notes
├── .gitignore           # Tell git what NOT to track
├── README.md            # Project description and instructions
└── pyproject.toml       # Python dependencies (with uv)
```

## Project Organization

Why this structure?

```         
+ Separation of concerns: Raw data stays pristine, processed data is separate

+ Findability: Six months from now, you'll know where everything is
+ Collaboration: Others can navigate your project easily

+ Scalability: Works for small and large projects
```

Key principles:

```         
+ Keep raw data in data/raw/ and NEVER modify it directly
+ All data processing should be scripted and reproducible
+ Results should be generated by code, not manually created
+ One project = one self-contained folder"
```

## File Naming Conventions

Some common conventions:


1.  **Lowercase with underscores**: `my-script.py` or `my_script.py`

2.  **Be descriptive**: Names should tell you what the file contains or does

3.  **NO SPACES**: For file names, you should replace whitespace with hyphens or underscores instead. Spaces cause issues in terminals. **For Python code and folders containing Python code, it is recommended to avoid hyphens too as Python has difficulty importing code from folders or files with hyphens or any special characters besides underscores. Using hyphens for data files is perfectly fine.**

4.  **Use number prefixes for sequences**: `01_`, `02_`, `03_` keeps scripts in order

5.  **Include dates if relevant**: `YYYY_MM_DD` or `YYYYMMDD` to format sorts chronologically (you may also use hyphens, i.e. `YYYY-MM-DD` for data files and other files or folders that DO NOT contain Python code).

6.  **Consistent within a project**: Pick a style and stick with it

For general file management naming conventions see [Harvard's guide to file naming](https://datamanagement.hms.harvard.edu/plan-design/file-naming-conventions). 

For Python specific naming conventions (for files and folders, but also for the names of variables, functions, classes, etc. see [The Pep 8 Style Guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#naming-conventions).

## Virtual Environments

**Problem**

-   Project A (from 2022) needs pandas version 1.3

-   Project B (new project) needs pandas version 2.0

## Version Control (Git)

```{=html}
<!--
"Version control is like 'track changes' for code—on steroids.

    Tracks every change you make
    Lets you go back to previous versions
    Essential for collaboration
    GitHub/GitLab provide backups and sharing
    We'll initialize git for our projects today"
    -->
```

## IDEs (Integrated Development Environments)

An IDE is your coding workspace. Some examples (Visual Studio Code, Pycharm, Spyder, etc.). Today we are using Visual Studio Code (VSC) because":

Free and open source Excellent Python support Built-in git integration Integrated terminal IntelliSense (code completion) Debugging tools Works with both .py scripts and Jupyter notebooks Huge extension ecosystem Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux

## Documentation

Most important document: README.md file. This is where users go to first to learn more about a project.

What goes in a README:

1.  project title & overview
2.  how to set up / get started
3.  how to use
4.  data description
5.  description of other content
6.  how to cite
7.  license information

```{=html}
<!--
"Always include a README.md that explains:

    What your project does
    How to install dependencies
    How to run your code
    Future you (and other researchers) will thank present you!"

Quick interactive poll: "Who currently uses any of these practices? Don't worry if you don't—we're starting today!"
-->
```
