# Setup Instructions

This document provides detailed instructions for installing and setting up Visual Studio Code and Python (via uv)

## Table of Contents

## Step 1: Install Visual Studio Code

-   Go to <https://code.visualstudio.com/>

-   Download for your operating system (it auto-detects)

-   Install VS Code with default options

-   Launch VS Code

Once opened, let's install essential extensions (click Extensions icon - looks like four squares - in sidebar or press Ctrl+Shift+X):

1.  Search for **'Python'** - install the one by Microsoft

2.  Search for **'Jupyter'** - install the one by Microsoft

3.  Search for **'Quarto'** - use to create and work with Quarto notebooks and presentations

4.  Search for **'Git History'** (optional but useful)

These extensions will help VS Code work with Python.

## Step 2: Install uv (5 minutes)

Now we install `uv`, which will handle EVERYTHING else for us - including Python itself. This is the modern way to manage Python projects. `uv` is a fast Python package and project manager that we'll use for managing dependencies.

Open the integrated terminal in VS Code:

-   **Windows/Linux**: Press ``` Ctrl + `` ``` (that's the backtick key, usually above Tab)

-   **Mac**: Press ``` Cmd + `` ```

Or use the menu: Terminal → New Terminal

### Windows (PowerShell)

```{powershell}
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

#### macOS/Linux

```{bash}
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

#### Verify Installation

After installation completes:

1.  **Close the terminal tab** in VS Code (click the trash can icon)

2.  **Open a new terminal** (Ctrl/Cmd + \` again)

3.  Verify installation by typing:

```{bash}
uv --version
```

You should see something like `uv 0.4.x` or higher.

*Troubleshooting time: Common issues*

-   "If 'uv' is not recognized: The installation script may need admin rights, or you may need to restart VS Code"

-   "Mac users: If you get a security warning, go to System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Allow"

## Step 3: Let uv Install Python (3 minutes)

With `uv` we don't need to install Python separately. When we create our first project, uv will automatically install the right Python version for us. But let's verify uv can find or install Python:

```{bash}
uv python list
```

This shows all Python versions uv knows about. Don't worry if it's empty - uv will download Python when we need it.

If you want to pre-install Python 3.12 (the current stable version):

```{bash}
uv python install 3.12
```

This downloads and installs Python 3.12, managed by uv. No PATH configuration needed, no installers to run, no clicking through installation wizards.

Verify:

```{bash}
uv python list
```

## Advantages of using uv for Python Installation

1.  No need to go to python.org, download an installer
2.  don't need to worry about "Add to PATH" (a common error in Python installation, when a Python IDE like VSC cannot find Python or cannot find the version of Python you want to use)
3.  don't need to worry about conflicting with other Python installations
